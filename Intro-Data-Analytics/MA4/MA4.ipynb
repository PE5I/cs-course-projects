    "1. (10 pts) Show how you can use these operations to implement a queue (operations `Q = create_queue()`, `enqueue(i)`, `i = dequeue()`)\n",

    "Write a program that implements a queue using a standard list implementation (see [M&R 3.12](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/ImplementingaQueueinPython.html)) and a queue using your solution to conceptual question #1.

    "# Conceptual Questions Answer/Reponses\n",
    "(1) We can use two stacks for implementing a queue.\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "stack_1 = create_stack()\n",
    "stack_2 = create_stack()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we initially push data into `stack_1`, the first item will be at the bottom while the last item is on the top (LIFO order). By using a second stack, we can reverse this order again by push()'ing all of the pop() operations from `stack_1` to `stack_2`. By doing this, we rearrange the data in `stack_2` in the order of which they were push() in `stack_1`, so when you pop() `stack_2`, you get items in a FIFO-order. That is: the first item which was push() in `stack_1` is the first item that is pop() from `stack_2`, the second item which was push() in `stack_1` is the first item that is pop() from `stack_2`, ... etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "stack_1.push(data)\n",
    "... # push all data into stack_1\n",
    "stack_2.push(stack_1.pop())\n",
    "... # then push all the data from stack_1 into stack_2 using the pop() data from stack_1\n",
    "stack_2.pop() # now that all the data is in stack_2, pop()'ing stack_2 should return all the items in a nature of the queue (FIFO)\n",
    "```\n",
    "(2) Worst case of dequeuing with two stacks should be O(n). This is because you have to transfer all of the data into the first stack with push(), then pop() them from the first stack as you push() the pop()'ed item from the first stack to the second stack. Then to dequeue, you simply pop() `stack_2`. All these operations are linear in nature, and so their total time complexity should amount to something resembling a linear trend O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) It would be 2n. The first set of pop() is for `stack_1` to transfer data to the second stack, which requires n pop(), then the second set of pop() is for `stack_2` which requires another n-pop(). Add them together $n+n$ and we get $2n$ total pop() for the implementation."
