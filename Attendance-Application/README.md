# Attendance-Application
Programming assignment from CPTS_122, fall semester 2017. A commandline application that stores and records student attendance.

This is a copy of the project before it was completed, so some functions and class methods are not finished.

(For linux) To build this project, enter the root of the Attendance Application and run the following command

`mkdir build; cmake -B build -S .; cmake --build build`

Then `cd build` and `./attendance_app` to run.
